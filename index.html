        As a freshman doing my undergrad as a Pre-Business major, I am continuously working to increase my experience in the workforce through various opportunities that are given to me. I have a considerable deal of experience with teams and leadership roles. Additionally, I can quickly adapt to new technology and software due to my media work on various social media and editing platforms. As an early board member in my schoolâ€™s DECA chapter, I fostered a collaborative environment as I pitched fundraising ideas and outreach methods to the student body. In robotics, I held several key roles; I was able to develop strong communication skills and lead major projects (like partnering with the Seattle Pride Parade) to increase our outreach within our communities. s a freshman doing my undergrad as a Pre-Business major, I am continuously working to increase my experience in the workforce through various opportunities that are given to me.

            <p>
              Every summer for 4-5 weeks, two days a week I teach 5-8 kids. I ensure that families and students are engaged in the class curriculum and outside optional practice. I contact parents to get emergency contact info and the childâ€™s previous art experience and establish a better connection with the family. As an individual with a very artistic environment, this early job was a great way to combine my passion into something I could share with younger kids.
